# Web Infrastructure Design

This project focuses on designing web infrastructure from simple to complex, secure, and scalable systems. Each task builds upon the previous one, introducing new concepts and addressing limitations.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this project, you will be able to:

- Draw comprehensive diagrams of web stack architectures
- Explain the role of each component in a web infrastructure
- Understand system redundancy and high availability concepts
- Know key acronyms: LAMP, SPOF, QPS
- Design secure and monitored web infrastructures
- Scale web applications effectively

## Key Concepts

### Web Server vs Application Server

**Web Server:**
- Handles HTTP/HTTPS requests
- Serves static content (HTML, CSS, JS, images)
- Examples: Nginx, Apache
- Lightweight and fast for static files
- Can act as reverse proxy

**Application Server:**
- Executes business logic and dynamic code
- Handles database connections
- Processes user requests with server-side logic
- Examples: Gunicorn, uWSGI, Tomcat
- Resource-intensive for complex operations
- Manages application state and sessions

### Why Separate Them?
- **Performance**: Web server optimized for static content, app server for dynamic processing
- **Scalability**: Can scale each component independently
- **Security**: Web server acts as buffer, hiding application server
- **Resource Management**: Better allocation of CPU/memory per function

## Tasks Overview

### Task 0: Simple Web Stack
- Single server hosting all components
- Basic LAMP stack configuration
- Introduction to DNS and domain mapping

### Task 1: Distributed Web Infrastructure
- Load balancer introduction
- Multiple server setup
- Database Primary-Replica configuration

### Task 2: Secured and Monitored Web Infrastructure
- Firewall implementation
- HTTPS/SSL encryption
- Monitoring and alerting systems

### Task 3: Scale Up
- Component separation for optimal performance
- Load balancer clustering for high availability
- Dedicated servers for specific roles

## Infrastructure Components

### Load Balancer (HAProxy)
- Distributes incoming requests across multiple servers
- Provides high availability and fault tolerance
- Can be configured in Active-Active or Active-Passive modes
- Supports various distribution algorithms (Round Robin, Least Connections, etc.)

### Database Clustering
- **Primary (Master)**: Handles all write operations
- **Replica (Slave)**: Handles read operations and provides backup
- Automatic synchronization between nodes
- Improves read performance and provides redundancy

### Monitoring Systems
- Collects system metrics (CPU, memory, disk, network)
- Tracks application performance and errors
- Provides alerting for threshold breaches
- Examples: Sumologic, Datadog, Prometheus

### Security Components
- **Firewalls**: Filter network traffic, block unauthorized access
- **SSL/TLS Certificates**: Encrypt data transmission
- **HTTPS**: Secure HTTP protocol preventing eavesdropping

## Common Issues and Solutions

### Single Point of Failure (SPOF)
- **Problem**: One component failure brings down entire system
- **Solution**: Redundancy, clustering, and failover mechanisms

### Scaling Challenges
- **Vertical Scaling**: Adding more power to existing servers
- **Horizontal Scaling**: Adding more servers to distribute load
- **Database Scaling**: Read replicas, sharding, clustering

### Security Vulnerabilities
- Unencrypted data transmission
- Lack of access controls
- Missing security monitoring
- Inadequate firewall rules

## Best Practices

1. **Separation of Concerns**: Dedicated servers for specific roles
2. **Redundancy**: No single points of failure
3. **Monitoring**: Comprehensive system and application monitoring
4. **Security**: Defense in depth with multiple security layers
5. **Scalability**: Design for growth and traffic increases
6. **Documentation**: Clear architecture documentation and runbooks

## Project Requirements

- All diagrams must be hand-drawn/whiteboarded
- Screenshots required for each completed task
- Oral explanation to mentors without notes
- Focus on requirements, avoid unnecessary details
- 30-minute time limit per explanation

## Task 3: Scale Up Infrastructure

### Requirements
- Add 1 additional server
- Configure HAProxy load balancer cluster (2 load balancers)
- Separate components onto dedicated servers:
  - Web Server (Nginx) - dedicated server
  - Application Server - dedicated server  
  - Database Server - dedicated server

### Why Each Element is Added

**Additional Server:**
- Eliminates single server bottleneck
- Allows component separation for optimized performance
- Provides better resource allocation per service

**Load Balancer Cluster:**
- Removes load balancer as single point of failure
- Provides high availability for traffic distribution
- Active-Active configuration ensures continuous service

**Component Separation:**
- **Dedicated Web Server**: Optimized for serving static content and handling HTTP requests
- **Dedicated Application Server**: Focused on business logic processing and dynamic content generation
- **Dedicated Database Server**: Optimized for data storage, indexing, and query processing

### Benefits of This Architecture
- **Performance**: Each server optimized for specific function
- **Scalability**: Can scale each component independently
- **Reliability**: Failure in one component doesn't affect others
- **Maintenance**: Can update/restart services without full system downtime
- **Resource Efficiency**: Better CPU, memory, and storage utilization
